For my blog I was using a CSS-in-JS solution. In this post I will explain why 
I switched back to a simple plain css solution.

import Layout from '../../components/Layout.gen'

For some projects CSS-in-JS is great, it adds a lot of structure and you get a
ton of great features. I've quickly switche to CSS-in-JS on this blog with the
bs-css-emotion package. It worked great and the statical typing of CSS names and
values is also great. But it does come at a cost. Loading the homepage would
load ~75 kB of JavaScript, that might not sound that bad, but 30 kB was just the
CSS-in-JS library I used. That is 40%. On top of that, also the CSS had to be
added. It also adds a tiny bit of overhead, but for a site as small as this, it
does make a "big" difference. Using simple CSS in a site like this is very good
managable. So I've moved back to a very simple just plain CSS setup that is
loaded using JavaScript ofcourse, because, if it doesn't at least touch
JavaScript a tiny bit, what kind of web developer are you...

export default ({ children }) => <Layout title="Back to old school CSS, or why I stopped using CSS-in-JS">{children}</Layout>
