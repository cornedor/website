Dear reader,

Often i've had to hunt for little tricks I would use for certain tasks,
and sometimes those little tricks would include multiple steps. Other
times I invented my own little tricks. But often I would also lose those
little tricks. Thats why Iâ€™ve decided to start a blog. A place where I
can store those little tricks, and also share them with the world. But I
hope this will also be a place where I can share more that just a few
little tricks.

This website will also be a platform for me to test out new technologies,
learn new languages and learn new ways to optimise it's speed, accesibility
and look.

I hope find something interesting on this website, and maybe even learn
something.

Yours faithfully

CornÃ© Dorrestijn
